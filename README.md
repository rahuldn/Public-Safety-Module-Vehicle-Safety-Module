# Public-Safety-Module-VSM
The aim of the project is to reduce the death rate that is caused due to road accidents. As per the survey conducted previously, it is noted that there is a gradual increase in the death rates over the last few decades. In order to contradict this problem, the project was developed. Force-Resistive sensors are placed on the bumpers of the car (front and back), which detects for any impact on the car. Whenever there is an impact on the bumpers an SMS will be sent to the concerned family members, near-by Ambulance and Police Station along with the GPS location of the person depending on the impact. Suppose the intensity of impact on the bumper is comparatively less than the preset threshold, the whole process of sending SMS will be terminated. If the impact is greater than the preset threshold, an SMS will be sent by triggering the alarm inside the car. During the impact, if the person inside the car is alright, he can just press the SOS switch, which will terminate the entire process.  Even before the impact, a notification will be sent to the person in the form of a buzzer or any other means of indicators(to alter the person in the car), in order to prevent the driver from a collision.
